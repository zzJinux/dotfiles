## Manual things

### Start

Before installing the dotfiles, it's highly recommended to install the following:
- Go
- Docker Desktop
- Raycast
- or else?

### SSH

My default theme: `MyCai.terminal`

### Bash completions

```

kubectl completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/kubectl

# openstack
openstack complete --shell bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/openstack
```
