## `less -FSRXc`

- `-F` or `--quit-if-one-screen`: This causes `less` to automatically exit if the entire file can be displayed on the first screen【11†source】.

- `-S` or `--chop-long-lines`: This causes lines longer than the screen width to be chopped (truncated) rather than wrapped. The portion of a long line that does not fit in the screen width is not displayed until you press RIGHT-ARROW【16†source】.

- `-R` or `--RAW-CONTROL-CHARS`: This is similar to `-r`, but only ANSI "color" escape sequences and OSC 8 hyperlink sequences are output in "raw" form. Unlike `-r`, the screen appearance is maintained correctly, provided that there are no escape sequences in the file other than these types of escape sequences【15†source】.

- `-X` or `--no-init`: This disables sending the termcap initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal. This is sometimes desirable if the deinitialization string does something unnecessary, like clearing the screen【17†source】.

- `-c` or `--clear-screen`: This causes full screen repaints to be painted from the top line down. By default, full screen repaints are done by scrolling from the bottom of the screen【7†source】.

So when you run `less -FSRXc`, `less` will display the content of the file with these settings: it will exit if the file fits in one screen, it will not wrap long lines, it will correctly display ANSI color escape sequences, it will not send the termcap initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal, and it will repaint the screen from the top line down when necessary.
